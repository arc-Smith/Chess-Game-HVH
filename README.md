## Overview

This is a chess game implemented using Python and Tkinter (standard GUI package). This chess game includes custom pixel-art designs for the pieces, which I created using the pixel design application Aseprite. The game provides a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows players to move the pieces by clicking on them with the mouse and it implements the touch-move rule. The overarching goal is to have both human vs human (HvH) not only on a single laptop but also over a network using TCP sockets, enabling long-distance play on different machines.
